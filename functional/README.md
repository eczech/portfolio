# Functional Code Samples

These projects contain executable implementations of solutions for several problems.

Problems and Solutions:

1.> *Find the integer in an enumerable list or array of integers with the most consecutive appearances* 

Python solution with time complexity **O(n)** and space complextiy **O(1)** => [solution](/functional/cs_problems/python/most_consecutive_item)
2.
