Hello!  I'm [Eric](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-czech/8/992/202).  

As a software engineer / data enthusiast, I've been lucky enough to work on some pretty cool projects in the last couple years and this repo contains examples of that work.  The examples within are meant to showcase the use of cutting-edge open-source tools, core computer science concepts, and systems design principles for managing/analyzing information in a distributed, polyglottic environment.
